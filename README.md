Comparison of various sorting algorithms in Java

Data can be organized in a multitude of ways. In this specific study the arrangements are arrays of Java wrapper class ‘Integers’. The arrays are tested with four different arrangements to see how each sort performs on each one.  The arrays are to be sorted from the smallest element to the largest. The first type of array is an array already arranged in increasing order, the second is an array arranged in decreasing order, the third is an array of randomly generated numbers, and finally the fourth is an array generated to test the worst case scenario of the quickSort method. Two series of test arrays were used. One consisting of smaller arrays: 1000 through 10,000, incremented by 1000 (10 arrays total) and another series of larger arrays: 10,000 through 100,000 incremented by 10,000. The random array was generated by first generating an increasing array and then looping through it n times, each time selecting a random element, then performing a series of exlusive-or operations with the ith iteration to randomize it. The worst case array was generated by creating an array of all one number. Why this is the worst case will be discussed in detail later. The arrays are timed in milliseconds and integer-rounded to the nearest whole millisecond.
